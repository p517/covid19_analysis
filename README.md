# 🦠 The Evolution of COVID-19 in New York State: A Visual Timeline

This Tableau project visualizes the COVID-19 pandemic’s trajectory across New York State, highlighting the interplay between vaccination efforts, healthcare infrastructure, and demographic trends over time.

---

## 🧠 Hypothesis Overview

1. **Older adults (65+) are more likely to be hospitalized and face higher fatality rates.**
2. **Higher vaccination rates correlate with fewer ICU admissions (Queens County).**
3. **More COVID-19 cases lead to higher fatalities (State & County-wise).**
4. **No significant short-term correlation between first dose and next-quarter admissions.**
5. **More staffed beds lead to more patient discharges across healthcare facilities.**
